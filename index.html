            <p>On March 30, 2022, Barcelona and Real Madrid's rivalry was at the forefront of football. But this time, it was the women's teams who were centre stage as they played out a seven-goal thriller in front of a world record crowd of 91,553 fans.

              DAZN takes a look back at that awe-inspiring night and the impact it has had on the women's game, and football in general, across the globe.
