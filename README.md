# WatchWomensFootballProject 
Concept:
I wanted to build a resource that makes it easier for myself and others to keep up to date with the latest football games for the top Womens Football Competitions.

Initial elements that I would like to build on the webpage: 
- calendar / timetable view of matches per league
- links to matches or streaming services

This project is my first web project and I welcome any contributions.
