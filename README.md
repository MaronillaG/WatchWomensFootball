# WatchWomensFootballProject 
PLANNNING 

Concept:
I wanted to build a resource that makes it easier for myself and others to keep up to date with the latest football games for the top Womens Football Competitions. I wanted a page that has a quick overview of the leagues and fun media related to womens football. To acheive this a clean design structure and interactive clickable links will be used. 

Initial elements that I would like to build on the webpage: 
- calendar / timetable view / monthly overview  of key matches per league
- links to matches or streaming services

Revised elements: 
- links to fixtures of current major competions
- suggested documentaries on women's football 
- section on finding your club


This project is my first web project and I welcome any contributions. 


BUILDING

HTML - keeping as minimal as possible
CSS - styling, 
JS - displaying the current date, 


Problems encountered & Solutions:
1. Overall website design: After adding required elements, the initial desgin of the website didn't look professional and so I had to change the design to have a cleaner look. I searched for examples of other sports blogs or websites with a professional look for pointers. Changes were made to the colour scheme (from bright neon to more neutral) and simplifying the sections applying bold backgrounds for section headings and bright backgrounds for text/picture sections.

2. Learning about DOM Manipulation and using JS to generate and show the current date. I watched freeCodeCamp tutorials and other youtube tutorials to achieve this.

3. Testing for responsivity so that the page accounts for smaller screens.
